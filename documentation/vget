In order to test github we shall develop two small, single responsibility, applications.

The purpose of these applications shall be to help determine my vote in the upcoming dutch parliamentary election.

This shall be done by analysing the voting behaviour of the current members of parliament.

Therefore one application shall be written to collect the voting records of the current members of parliament, while a second application shall determine the correlations between these votes.

With these correlations we can determine the actual similarities and differences between political parties, and the points in which they tend to compromise.

The data of this application shall remain private through the use of encryption. 

To encrypt the data we shall use PGP - a form of open source public key encryption.
