Story: obtain the voting record of parliamentarians in the dutch Tweede Kamer

As a dutch citizen,
in order to determine who to vote for in the parliamentary elections,
I want to be able to analyse the behaviour of existing parliamentarians through their voting record
and so I want to obtain the voting record of existing parliamentarians.


Scenario 1:
When the application is run,
Then it connects to https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/stemmingsuitslagen
Whence it obtains the voting record starting today and reaching back to 2012-09-20,# which shall be stored.
Voting records that have been obtained previously do not need to be obtained again.
Finally the application terminates.

Scenario 2:
When the application is run,
but cannot connect to https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/stemmingsuitslagen
then it terminates with an error message.

Scenario 3:
When the application is run,
and connects to https://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/stemmingsuitslagen
but finds that the data is no longer available in a compatible format
then it terminates with an error message.
